# Tasty Scraper

## Description
I look to cook when I have the opportunity. I often find recipes I like on the website [tasty.co](http://tasty.co/). I'm fond of automation and the command-line, so I figured I'd write a script to fetch details about a recipe from there.

## Dependencies
This script uses BeautifulSoup and requests.

## Usage

```
./scraper <tasty.co recipe URL>
```
