# Tasty Scraper

## Description
I look to cook when I have the opportunity. I often find recipes I like on the website [tasty.co](http://tasty.co/). I'm fond of automation and the command-line, so I figured I'd write a script to fetch details about a recipe from there.

This scraper takes in a URL to a tasty recipe and it outputs nicely-formatted JSON.

## Dependencies
This script uses BeautifulSoup and requests.

## Usage

```
./scraper <tasty.co recipe URL>
```

I am happy to remove this repository from GitHub if there are any complaints regarding breaches in the user agreement, though having read through this I believe this script falls under the "we grant each user of the Services a worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to view, print, download, and display locally Content, to the extent we hold such rights" section of that document.
